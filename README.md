# no-idea-engine
No-idea-engine is an OpenGL 3.3 game engine heavily inspired by the architecture of GameMaker Studio. The goal is to create an engine suitable for rapid prototyping, as well as releasing moderately-scoped games. Target platforms are PC and Linux. Mac support theoretically exists but as they've deprecated OpenGL, I do not test on that platform.
